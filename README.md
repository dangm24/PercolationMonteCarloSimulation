# PercolationMonteCarloSimulation
  
Estimates the percolation threshold vai Monte Carlo Simulation.  
Runs N experiements on a T by T sized grid.  
Returns mean (percolation threshold), standard deviation and confidence levels (low and hi). 

Constructor takes N^2 time and all methods take constant time.  
Used classes provided by instructor. (algs4.jar)
